Review of Academic Literature and Technical Documentation on User Authentication in Android and iOS: A Focus on Mobile Security Threats like Phishing and Malware
Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1	Background of the Study
Despite the growing number of innovative ways to authenticate users, password-based authentication is still one of the most popular methods of all (Shen et al., 2016). Passwords can easily be memorized and users at no cost are able to use them in their daily life (Shen et al., 2016). On the other side, passwords can be forgotten because of mixture of different passwords of various accounts (Nicholson et al., 2013). As time passes, different methods of authentication have gradually been introduced in the forms of biological and graphical passwords. The new emerging trends of authentication systems are a combination of two or more methods. These systems employ the combination to distinguish true users from so-called users. There are three main schemes into which authentication systems fall (Almuairfi et al., 2013), namely what you know, what you have, and what you are.
As the researchers discuss the three mentioned categories, they will also analyze different kinds of each pertinent model. To clarify more, the username and password that are regularly used on websites are in the first group of authentication model whereas the credit card is counted as the ownership factor to check the validity during an authentication process.
Mobile devices have become an integral part of modern life, facilitating communication, financial transactions, and access to sensitive information. As reliance on mobile platforms such as Android and iOS increases, so do the security threats that target these platforms. User authentication mechanisms are critical in safeguarding users from security threats, including phishing and malware attacks.

 Literature Review
2.1 Overview of Mobile Security
Recent years have shown a signiﬁcant increase in the popularity and ubiquity of mobile devices among users all around the globe. These devices, based on a speciﬁc operating system, enable users to install a vast variety of applications, commonly referred to as “apps,” from online sources called markets: Apple App Store, and Google Play .The aforementioned apps are the essence of smart- phones, enriching their functionality and enhancing the everyday lives of their users. The app markets allow users to perform a quick search and installation of new apps, but at the same time, they are also a source of diﬀerent kinds of malware disguised as normal apps. Nowadays, mobile devices are subject to a wide range of security challenges and malicious threats mobile revolution has empowered and inﬂuenced users to move almost all of their everyday operations into the mobile environment and so-called mobile applications. Hence, we can observe rapid growth in the domains of both mobile developers and users. Mobile devices are treated by their users as very personal tools, mainly used to facilitate everyday operations, but they also serve to store very sensitive personal information.
Contemporary mobile applications are ubiquitous and very easy to install on almost every mobile operating system: iOS, Android, Windows phone, etc. As a result of aggressive competition among application providers, we can observe more and more advanced and customized applications appearing on the market, resolving complex problems. These applications profoundly change a user’s behavior by facilitating their day-to-day transactions in recent years, mobile applications have had to face a wide variety of external and internal security threats. To address this growing issue, both research studies and business organizations have developed and promoted best practices to this extent. However, to the best of my knowledge, there are few (if any) comprehensive studies which diagnose the status of knowledge within this domain
from these two antagonistic objectives. There for, the goal of this study is to identify and analyze security threats to mobile applications on the one hand and contemporary best practices on the other hand Mobile security encompasses a range of practices and technologies designed to protect mobile devices and their users from threats. It includes measures to secure hardware, software, and user data.
2.2 User Authentication Methods
User authentication acts as the first line of defense against unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data making it a fundamental component of cybersecurity. Authentication mechanisms are designed to verify the identity of a user trying to gain access to a system, typically by checking a credential like a password, token, or biometric signature against a stored reference (Bonneau et al., 2015). Traditional user authentication methods, such as passwords, have been the most common for a long time, but they present significant security vulnerabilities. Users often create weak passwords or reuse them across multiple 7 platforms, which increases the risk of credential theft, phishing attacks, and unauthorized access (Das et al., 2014). Schaffer 2015 emphasizes that continuous user authentication methods could provide more effective means of authenticating mobile device users. Stylios et al. 2016 and Shnidman 2017 further support the claim that user authentication based on continuous user authentication can provide high accuracy of authentication. Biometric authentication methods, such as fingerprint or facial recognition have been introduced to help enhance security beyond passwords. These methods rely on unique physical traits which are more difficult to replicate than a password. The biometric characteristics include face, fingerprint, hand geometry, iris, keystroke, signature, and voice (Jain et al., 2016). Although biometric methods provide greater security than traditional authentication mechanisms like passwords, they still only provide a single point verification process, leaving systems vulnerable if an unauthorized user gains access after the initial log in. To address the security challenges beyond the initial log in, there was a shift towards continuous user authentication systems. Unlike traditional methods of only verifying during the initial log in, continuous user authentication systems continuously monitor a user's behavior and identity throughout an entire session. Behavioral biometrics like typing patterns, touch dynamics, and gait are used to provide the ongoing verification (Mahbub, 2020). This approach adds another layer of security by ensuring that any unauthorized attempt is detected early (de Lima et al., 2021). 
2.2.1 Password-based Authentication
Password-based authentication remains one of the most common methods for securing mobile devices. Studies (e.g., Bonneau et al., 2012) highlight its simplicity but also its vulnerability to phishing attacks and poor user practices.
The concept of a user id and password is a cost effective and efficient method of maintaining a shared secret between a user and a computer system. Identifying a user is essential for the application of security in the form of permissions to various objects, processes and access to resources. User authentication in computer systems based on passwords has been a cornerstone of computer security for decades. The authentication process is embedded in many systems, in many different variations. In each case, one common aspect is the focus on mapping authentication data to specific authorized users for a specific application. And this central focus, the mapping, is designed from the perspective of the specific system or application, encompassing its set of valid users. The implementation of user authentication using a password, from an application point of view was a valid assumption when there were only a few applications compared to numbers of users. Today, with the rise of the Internet and a push for ubiquitous computing, this low application count per user assumption does not hold true. Users have multiple accounts on multiple systems. Users must to remember multiple IDs and multiple passwords for the wide range of computer based services they use. This has placed a strain on user memory and users have developed memory aides, such as password lists, to assist them in the task of keeping accounts and passwords straight. The purpose of this paper is to present a conceptual model of password-based security across multiple systems connected by user activity. We emphasize the effect of user generated schemes to assist in the user’s management of IDs and passwords, and the effect of these memory aides on system security. Examination of system security from a user perspective illuminates
interconnections and pathways between systems which are not visible from a specific application perspective. User password memory aids affect overall system security at the individual application level in two ways. Users’ security is decreased, with the memory aid itself becoming a source of risk. And application security also suffers because of the inter-system relationships created by the memory aids. The application-centric focus of software developers and system engineers fails to the user-centric and system-wide implications of password-based risk. The acceptance of these issues requires a change in mindset on the part of system developers, embracing each new application as part of a larger, greater system (as opposed to an application centric view). To achieve desired levels of systemwide security will require an understanding of the cognitive limitations of users and the behaviors which result from these limitations. The conceptual model presented here illustrates some opportunities for system wide improvement of password-based risk.
2.2.2 Biometric Authentication
Biometrics (ancient Greek: bios ="life", metron ="measure") refers to two very different fields of study and application. The first, which is the older and is used in biological studies, including forestry, is the collection, synthesis, analysis and management of quantitative data on biological communities such as forests. Biometrics in reference to biological sciences has been studied and applied for several generations and is somewhat simply viewed as "biological statistics". Authentication is the act of establishing or confirming something (or someone) as authentic, that is, that claims made by or about the thing are true. A short overview in this field can be divided into three parts and they are Past, Present and Future. Information security is concerned with the assurance of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information in all forms. There are many tools and techniques that can support the management of information security. But system based on biometric has evolved to support some aspects of information security. Biometric authentication supports the facet of identification, authentication and non-repudiation in information security. Biometric authentication has grown in popularity as a way to provide personal identification. Person’s identification is crucially significant in many application and the hike in credit card fraud and identity theft in recent years indicate that this is an issue of major concern in wider society. Individual passwords, pin identification or even token based arrangement all have deficiencies that restrict their applicability in a widely-networked society. Biometric is used to identify the identity of an input sample when compared to a template, used in cases to identify specific people by certain characteristics. Possessionbased: using one specific "token" such as a security tag or a card and knowledge-based: the use of a code or password. Standard validation systems often use multiple inputs of samples for sufficient validation, such as particular characteristics of the sample. This intends to enhance security as multiple different samples are required such as security tags and codes and sample dimensions. So, the advantage claimed by biometric authentication is that they can establish an unbreakable one-to-one correspondence between an individual and a piece of data.
Biometric methods, such as fingerprint and facial recognition, offer enhanced security by utilizing unique physical characteristics. According to Jain et al. (2016), biometric authentication provides a higher level of security but raises privacy concerns.

2.2.3 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
MFA combines multiple authentication factors to enhance security. Research by Alpar et al. (2015) shows that MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access but may impact user convenience.
2.3 Phishing and Malware Threats
Everybody is at risk when it comes to phishing victimization. This conclusion was drawn last year by Leukfeldt based upon an analysis of phishing victims. The conclusion was both disappointing and intriguing. Disappointing because no one, clearly defined group could be pinpointed who are at increased risk of victimization. This makes target hardening a lot more difficult and limits specific prevention campaigns aimed at particular groups, e.g. those who engage in dangerous online activities. Intriguing because, based on routine activity theory, it was expected that, besides financial characteristics (value), online activities (visibility) and online accessibility in particular would play a role in determining the extent to which someone is a suitable target for these internet fraudsters. Not one of the “digital” equivalents of visibility and accessibility, however, seemed to matter. The paper concluded that phishers apparently do not select their victims based on the digital trail victims leave when engaging in online activities, nor do they search for technical flaws in operating systems or browsers to get to users. A possible explanation was that it is the phisher’s tactic to approach large groups of potential victims through, for example, spam. In this way, a fraudster can basically reach anybody with an internet connection and an e-mail account. A recent study into phishing networks shows a phishing group which does indeed use such a method. The group sends out as many e-mails as possible to Dutch citizens. In the e-mail it is stated that the security of their internet banking account needs to be updated or the account will be closed. All the receiver has to do is click on the link in the e-mail to go to the bank’s secure website. Of course, this is a fake bank website under the control of the criminals. Once someone tries to log in, this information goes to the criminals. From this moment on, the criminals have access to the bank accounts of the victims. Due to a layered security policy, however, the criminals are not yet able to transfer money from these accounts. This requires unique transaction authentication codes. The phisher then simply makes a telephone call to victims to try to obtain these codes. The caller poses as a bank employee and claims to need that code in order to complete the new security settings. Information from the victim’s bank account is used to gain trust (e.g. the first (spam) e-mail about the new security, but also the type of account, registered names, last transactions, etc.).


2.3.1 Phishing Attacks
Phishing attacks trick users into providing sensitive information by posing as trustworthy entities. Studies by Jakobsson and Myers (2007) indicate that user education and advanced detection mechanisms are crucial in combating phishing.
2.3.2 Malware Attacks
Malware, including viruses and trojans, compromises mobile devices to steal data or cause harm. Research by Zhou and Jiang (2012) highlights the importance of secure app stores and regular updates in mitigating malware threats.
2.4 Comparative Analysis of Android and iOS Security
Android and iOS have distinct security architectures. Android's open-source nature offers flexibility but increases vulnerability, while iOS's closed ecosystem provides stronger default security measures. Studies by Enck et al. (2014) compare the effectiveness of security measures across these platforms.
